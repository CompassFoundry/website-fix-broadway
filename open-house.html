                  <p>Broadway Street is in need of repaving, and like other county roads, this corridor serves a variety of roadway users from people walking to transporters of regional freight. Additionally, this two-mile segment connects to diverse land uses, such as business districts, residential neighborhoods and industrial parks.

In coordination with the upcoming repaving project, neighborhood organizations and community members have urged the county to explore possible opportunities to make the roadway safer and more comfortable for all users. As part of the process, the county and city are reviewing data about vehicle volumes, turning movements, speed and crashes, and reviewing city and county documents to provide a basis for next steps.</p>
